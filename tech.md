# Technology in Prometheus

## Timeline

  1. 0:08:00 Large spaceship
  2. 0:13:00 cryopods for long distance transport
  3. 0:16:00 android (David)
  4. holographic projectors (they use these a lot throughout the movie)
  5. Med pods
  6. 3d terrain scanning and instant atmosphere scanning
  7. 0:31:00 flying 3D scanner laser orb mapping things ("pups")
      * 0:54:00 people managed to get lost, despite having a full 3d map of the entire place using the pups
  8. 0:35:15 ancient alien(?) technology, with buttons and more holograms
      * auto-death-recording tech, apparently
  9. 0:47:30 medical devices: scanner, stimulant and freezing things
  10. 0:49:00 android wearing some sort of ar/vr helmet
      * dream viewing
      * this might also have been at the very beginning of the movie (or at least the dream viewing)
  11. 0:50:40 "genetic view" instant dna analysis
  12. 0:55:40 suits have audio-visual transmitters
      * may also have been shown earlier
  13. 0:57:45 pretty cool little transparent possibly 3d display thing
  14. 1:14:50 alien cryo pods
  15. 1:22:30 really fancy med pods again (with lasers)
  16. 1:36:00 alien spaceship
  17. 1:27:00 alien "hyper sleep chambers" (cryo pods)

## Breakdown
  * Existing technology:
    * Atmosphere scanning
    * Audio-visual suit transmitters
    * Med scanner (cat scan)

  * Future:
    * Interstellar space travel (ion drive)
    * Cryo pods
    * Dream scanning

  * Emerging:
    * 3d mapping
    * Dna analysis
    * Surgical robot

  * Impossible:
    * Holographic displays
        * Probably impossible, unless maybe LED nanobots
    * FTL travel (35 lightyears from Earth, took 2 years)
    * Plausible:
    * Realistic android with facial muscles, possibly passing the Turing Test
