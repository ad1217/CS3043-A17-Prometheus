# Technology in Prometheus

## Timeline

  * 0:08:00 Large spaceship
  * 0:13:00 cryopods for long distance transport
  * 0:16:00 android (David)
  * holographic projectors (they use these a lot throughout the movie)
  * Med pods
  * 3d terrain scanning and instant atmosphere scanning
  * 0:31:00 flying 3D scanner laser orb mapping things ("pups")
      * 0:54:00 people managed to get lost, despite having a full 3d map of the entire place using the pups
  * 0:35:15 ancient alien(?) technology, with buttons and more holograms
      * auto-death-recording tech, apparently
  * 0:47:30 medical devices: scanner, stimulant and freezing things
  * 0:49:00 android wearing some sort of ar/vr helmet
      * dream viewing
      * this might also have been at the very beginning of the movie (or at least the dream viewing)
  * 0:50:40 "genetic view" instant dna analysis
  * 0:55:40 suits have audio-visual transmitters
      * may also have been shown earlier
  * 0:57:45 pretty cool little transparent possibly 3d display thing
  * 1:14:50 alien cryo pods
  * 1:22:30 really fancy med pods again (with lasers)
  * 1:36:00 alien spaceship
  * 1:27:00 alien "hyper sleep chambers" (cryo pods)

## Breakdown
Existing technology:
  * Atmosphere scanning
  * Audio-visual suit transmitters
  * Med scanner (cat scan)

Future:
  * Interstellar space travel (ion drive)
  * Cryo pods
  * Dream scanning

Emerging:
  * 3d mapping
  * Dna analysis
  * Surgical robot

Impossible:
  * Holographic displays
  * Probably impossible, unless maybe LED nanobots
  * FTL travel (35 lightyears from Earth, took 2 years)
  * Plausible:
  * Realistic android with facial muscles, possibly passing the Turing Test
